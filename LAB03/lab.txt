chainning : A process chain is a sequence of processes that are scheduled in the background for an event. 
Suppose there are three processes, and the first process is the parent process, and it is creating the child process, then this second process creates another process (third process), then the first process becomes the parent of the second one and the second process becomes the parent of the third process. So, a chain of processes is obtained, and thatâ€™s called a chain of processes.
