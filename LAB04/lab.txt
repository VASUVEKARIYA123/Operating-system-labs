What is Process?

Processes are basically the programs that are dispatched from the ready state and are scheduled in the CPU for execution. PCB (Process Control Block) holds the context of process. A process can create other processes which are known as Child Processes. The process takes more time to terminate, and it is isolated means it does not share the memory with any other process. The process can have the following states new, ready, running, waiting, terminated, and suspended. 
What is Thread?

Thread is the segment of a process which means a process can have multiple threads and these multiple threads are contained within a process. A thread has three states: Running, Ready, and Blocked. 

The thread takes less time to terminate as compared to the process but unlike the process, threads do not isolate.
